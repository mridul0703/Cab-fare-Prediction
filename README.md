## Cab Fare Prediction - New York City Taxi Fare Prediction(kaggle)

## Overview

Our machine learning project focuses on building and evaluating predictive models for cab fare prediction. We perform extensive data processing, cleaning, and feature extraction to prepare the dataset for model training. This project aims to predict cab fares accurately based on various input parameters such as distance, time, and location.
